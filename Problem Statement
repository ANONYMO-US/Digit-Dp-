QUESTION
SUPER PRIME NUMBERS-Positive integers whose decimal representation contains all the single digit prime numbers at least once.
Now find how many super prime numbers are present between the range (l,r).

Input Format
T(Number of testcases)
T lines follow with l,r as an input

Constraints
1<=T<=2*10^4
1<=L<=R<=10^18

SOLUTION
As it is clear from the connstrains we cannot use bruteforce here.Neither recursion will be effective as we have to calculate many testcases.So we will use an effective form
of recursion and store their results to avoid recalculation of these states so called digit dp.So lets get our hands dirty on code.
